# MuditaOS root source directory

Now it stores files that can, but don't have to, be copied to any target.
Used previously as root to copy files in MuditaOS repository.

# good practices

* Product files should be split in end nodes to product catalog i.e.:
`image/assets/audio/bell/...<product specific stuff here>`
* Try to somehow structure the files - do not just dump them randomly
