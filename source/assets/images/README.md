# source files

This catalog should contain source files used to create assets used on the targets
so that we would be able to tell - from what file output file was created and who added it.

Right now only `*png` used to create `*vpi` files are stored here.

On generation from `*png` `*vpi` files should be stored in `image/assets/images/<product>/...` catalogs
